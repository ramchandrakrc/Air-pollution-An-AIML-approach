# Air-pollution-An-AIML-approach
An artificial intelligence and machine learning approach to Air pollution

Project Overview: AI/ML-Driven Analysis of Air Pollution in IndiaThis project, undertaken as part of the Artificial Intelligence Lab curriculum, addresses the critical issue of air pollution, with a specific focus on Indian conditions. The project was inspired by real-world observations of the significant impact of air quality on daily life.

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:The initial phase involved acquiring datasets from Kaggle, a repository of data. Standard data preprocessing techniques were then applied. These included:Importing essential libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).Cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.Handling missing values using appropriate imputation or removal methods.

The key components of the dataset used in the analysis are:DateTimeCO (GT) - Carbon MonoxidePT08.S1 (CO) - Metal oxide sensor for CONMHC (GT) - Non-Methane HydrocarbonsC6H6 (GT) - BenzenePT08.S2 (NMHC) - Metal oxide sensor for NMHCNOx (GT) - Nitrogen OxidesPT08.S3 (NOx) - Metal oxide sensor for NOxNO2 (GT) - Nitrogen DioxideMethodology: 

Time Series Forecasting with ProphetThe project employs the Prophet API, a time-series forecasting tool developed by Facebook, to predict air pollution levels. Prophet is well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle common time-series characteristics, including:Seasonality: Variations in pollution levels across different times of the year.Trends: Long-term increases or decreases in pollution.Holidays: Effects of specific events on pollution.Missing Data: Robustness to gaps in the data.Outliers: Handling extreme values that may skew the analysis.The Prophet API's core component is the Prophet class, which was implemented in this project.  The date format was standardized to YYYY-MM-DD to ensure compatibility with the Prophet API.  The Prophet model was trained on the preprocessed dataset to forecast air pollution levels in specific regions.Results and Visualization:The project's final phase focused on data visualization to communicate the findings effectively. Tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to generate graphs representing air pollution trends. 

These visualizations included:Daily trends.Weekly trends.Yearly trends.These visualizations enable the identification of patterns and areas where air pollution is most severe.
